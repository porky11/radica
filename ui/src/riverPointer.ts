// Which River room contract rooms live under. River re-keys its room contract often (a room's key is
// BLAKE3(BLAKE3(room_contract.wasm) || CBOR{owner})), and publishes a signed pointer record at a fixed address naming
// the current code hash (freenet-core#5194, River's FREENET.md). We resolve it instead of trusting a built-in hash.
//
// river.wasm writes deltas for one River generation, BUNDLED_ROOM_CODE. When the pointer names a newer one, rooms stay
// readable but writes stop: a delta from an older river-core is what a newer contract re-keyed away from (riverctl
// does the same). Rebuilding river-wasm on River's new commit and updating BUNDLED_ROOM_CODE lifts it.

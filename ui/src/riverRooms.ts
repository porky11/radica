// Private rooms on River's room contract. The rules (who is a member, who may write, who reads what) are River's
// contract's, not Radica's: river.wasm builds the signed, sealed deltas and the contract refuses the rest.
//
// - A room is River's: its key is BLAKE3(room contract code || CBOR{owner}), with the code hash from River's pointer.
// - The owner key of a room is derived from its creator's identity key and the room id, so it needs no storage and
//   comes back on any device holding that identity.
// - A member's River key is their identity key (`identity.secretKey`, published as `encPub`), or the key an invite
//   link carried.
// - Only the owner invites (River's private rooms: only the owner signs the secret each member gets).
